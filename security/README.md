# Practical Security

Do something to improve your personal security setup - if you’re not using a
password manager, set one up. If you’re doing that, then set up two factor for
some of your accounts. If you’re doing that, then set up proper SSH keypairs for
services that support it (e.g. GitHub). And you can keep going - set up a PGP
keypair, consider simple dedicated hardware for second factor, set up a trusted
computer/VM running only open source software, set up a "sandboxed" environment
for web browsing that doesn't save state, etc.

Use the practices and approaches we learned about this week - this means pick
a suitably long *passphrase* to protect your password manager, and think about
what your threat model is and what services you want to trust with what
information. Some general tips:

- You are a software developer, which means you're a high value target (you are
a potential attack vector to anyone who runs your code)
- Unless you're working on something controversial for the political regime you
reside in, the NSA/Mossad/KGB/MI5/etc. are probably not your adversaries
- The sorts of threats you *should* worry about - common criminals/organized
crime, botnets, malware, extortion (stealing your files, DDoS-ing your service)
- For deciding whether or not to trust a service, consider history, reputation,
and incentives, as well as what countries it operates in (which will impact the
laws it is subject to, both in terms of disclosure and potential damages)

After you do some of the above, write 1-2 paragraphs summarizing what you did
(remember, a good security setup doesn't depend on security through obscurity,
so it should be safe to talk about it as long as you don't share actual
passwords/secrets). As a stretch goal, write a blog post about your security setup
describing what you’ve learned and tips you have for others.
